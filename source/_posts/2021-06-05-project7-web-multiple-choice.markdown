I built a simple multiple choice quiz with **React Hooks** and **Material UI.**

Checkout the demo [here](https://cereblanco.github.io/project7-web).

The contents of the quiz are from my previous project called **Learning English for Pinoys (LEAP)** - a government-funded desktop software that aims to develop language skills of highschool and college students and help them land employment at BPOs and call centers.
